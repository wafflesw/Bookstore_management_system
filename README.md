Project uses MYSQL 
When managaing employees within the database I recommend making a manger position via MYSQL terminal as the program itself has no way of making the first manager
When setting up HOST, USER, PORT, and PASSWORD can all be left alone if default settings were kept
PASS and DATABASE will most likely need to be changed to fit your settings

This program allows that user to choose from 6 different menus and add, update, view, and remove object from tables within the database.
